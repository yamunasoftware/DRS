# DRS (Drone Recovery System)

Computer Vision System to Use Drone Imaging to Locate Rocket After Landing

## Information

DRS is a project based upon the challenges of especially high-powered hobby rocketry. The main issue with the overall system of recovering rockets currently is the unreliability of GPS in more remote locations. The possible landing lcoations of these rockets is also too vast to search by hand; therefore, a technological solution is required. One of the best solutions that comes to mind is to use drone with a camera to search a large area for the rocket quickly. While machine learning is an option in this case to find the rocket. The rocket color may be washed out by the surrounding area; thus, the recommendation is that the rocket be mounted with a bright orange parachute to make the parachute easy to find.
